Type in the number of the function you would like to perform. Here is what each one does

2. View records; Displays all records for all students
3. Edit record; Edits a record for a specific student
4. Search for record; Searches for students name and displays their record
5. Delete record; Deletes a student record
6. Graduation check; returns true if the student can graduate, returns leftover requirements if not
7. Save and exit; saves and ends the program


currently working on moving this to firebase hosting, for database instead of .csv
